# Hacker Rank

HackerRank solutions done in Java. This page list mostly completed solutions. Please feel free to do a
pull request or open an issue to ask a question or to propose a better solution. This repository is mainly
for practice and self learning purposes. Most solutions are my own however some of them are from other authors as
I treated this as both a learning and understanding process for myself. I have mostly credited the authors where I could
and included where I obtained the sources used to obtain my answers.

##### Run instructions

Since I test most of the codes locally before uploading them onto Hacker Rank, I have a testcase.txt file.
You should replace this with "System.in" to run it on Hacker Rank. You will also need to remove the package
declaration.
